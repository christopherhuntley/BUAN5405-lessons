    "## Data, Information, and Knowledge\n",
    "The concepts in this lesson actually go all the way back to ancient times, when philosophers studied how they thought about ... thought. Plato, for example, spent significant time on the idea of [essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism): the idea that **every entity (physical or conceptual) has an essential form** that defines its substance. That form has **features** that characterize facts that distinguish it from other entities. Entities also have **functions** that they carry out in the world. These essential forms and functions together define **types** or **categories** that are considered eternal, at which point philosophy starts to become theology ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we still use this basic framework to model the world around us, though with slightly different terminology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data** refers to facts. Each fact has a **value** that captures substance instead of importance or meaning. The number 42 can mean lots of things to different people. If you are a Monty Python fan then perhaps you remember it from _The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. If you are baseball fan then it could mean Mariano Rivera or Jackie Robinson. Or it could just be the answer to \"What's 6 times 9?\" ... 42 of course, but only you are in base 13. \n",
    "- **Information** refers to facts that have an identified **meaning** and **structure**. When associating facts to entities the facts are given names, kind of like attaching sticky labels, so we know how each fact relates to the entity. For example we can say that 42 is the _Uniform Number_ (feature) of _Jackie Robinson, the famous baseball player_ (entity and essential type). Data can also have types, just like entities do. Is it 42 or \"42\" or 42.0? It matters a lot, at least to a data scientist. However, it's hard to tell without knowing how it is to be interpretted. \n",
    "- **Knowledge** refers to functionality: the ability to use information to do things. A knowledgable person can do a lot of things, once they have the necessary information. A less knowldgeable person might not be able to anything useful, even if given perfect information. In Python, the programs that we write are knowledge. It's how we get the computer to do what we want it to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, each of these things builds on the ones before it. We can of course continue on to wisdom (knowing what to do at a given time) and virtue (knowing right vs wrong), but it seems that we're getting back to theology again instead of science."

    "## Values and Types\n",

    "Returning to the example from the last section, let's consider 42, which can be represented as:\n",
    "- \"42\", a string of text characters\n",
    "- 42, an integer number between 41 and 43\n",
    "- 42.0, a rational number \n",
    "- 41.99999 (repeating forever)\n",

    "- If it is text then we can _literally_ extract it from a sentence. \n",
    "- If it is an integer then it might be the number of people at a holiday party.\n",
    "- If it is a rational number then it may the result of 420/10. \n",
    "- If it is a real number then it could be the value of the calculation 7.0 / 3.0 * 18.0, which is _of course_ 41.99999 (repeating). \n",

    "- **Names should be descriptive** enough that we, the programmers, know what each one stands for. Otherwise we can't follow each other's code without a road map, and who's got time for that? Even if we are the only ones to ever see the code, once a program gets larger than a couple dozen lines or so, it can get hard to remember everything. You want it to fit nicely in your head. \n",

    "- `this_is_the_theme_for_garrys_show` is certainly descriptive if it refers to the theme some from the _Garry Shandling Show_ but it may also be a bit long and too specific. What if Garry had chosen to rename his theme song? All our code would be trashed. \n",
    "- `in`, `for`,`def`, etc. are keywords. They are already taken.\n",
    "- `My Drive` has spaces in it. Python can't tell that `My` and `Drive` are part of the same name. Use underscores (`_`) between the words instead. \n",
    "- `My_Drive` also is bad form. In Python **variables should be lower case letters only.** Python will accept capital letters, but other programmers will complain. It's just not done. \n",
    "- `dollar$` is a bad name because it includes an illegal character. Leave that stuff for other languages. Python wants it clean. \n",

    "- ...\n",
    "\n",

    "- CONSTANTS (i.e., variables that don't actually vary) should be in `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`\n",
    "- Third-party data types (a.k.a., `classes`) should use `CamelCaseNaming` where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no underscores. \n",

    "Sometimes you can learn a lot from just one line of code. For example, let's revisit a line from the section on variable assignment:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person1 = first_name + \" \" + last_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this one line we see a **statement**, an **operator**, and **an expression**. (Actually, there are three expressions, but who's counting?)\n",
    "- the entire line of code `person1 = first_name + \" \" + last_name` is one **statement**\n",
    "- the assignment **operator** is denoted by the equals sign `=`\n",
    "- the calculation `first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an **expression**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A statement is the Python equivalent of a sentence.** It's one sytactically complete thought (for the programmer) or one syntactically complete unit of code to execute (for Python). Each time we ask the computer to do something, we give it a statement. If we give the computer a sequence of statement then it executes them one at a time in the order they are given. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as sentences in human language have syntactic structure (parts of speak), so do Python statements. In fact the precise grammar for all legal Python statements is defined in one surprisingly short document, [Python Language Definition](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). The grammar rules defined there break each sentence down into expressions, operations, and punctuation. Everything is covered in fine detail. Consider, for example, how Python defines integer number:   \n",
    "![Integer Grammar Rule](img/L2_1_Integer_Grammar.png)  \n",
    "While the notation (called BNR grammar, first used to design Fortran) is pretty arcane, just know that these 10 rules (one per line) together describe every possible integer in every possible format recognized by Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An expression is anything that can be executed to produce a value.** So, each calculation like `1+1` or `first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an expression but so is recalling the value of a variable like `first_name` or `last_name`. They each produce a value. That's their _function_. The _form_ of an expression is always some combination of variables, values, and operators. The values may themselves be expressions, and so it goes, with Python breaking down expressions into smaller and smaller expressions, until it arrives at so-called **literal** values (a.k.a., tokens). **Literals** are things like numbers or text strings that cannot be broken down into smaller parts without affecting their values. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An operator is a calculation, typically represented by a symbol like `+` or `%`.** In order for operators to be useful in expressions they have to be applied to one or more **operands** according to a specific pattern. For example the assignment operator _always_ applies the same pattern: _`variable`_ `=` _`expression`_. As we learned before, the expression on the right is always evaluated first and then assigned to the variable on the left. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since operations are just a special kind of expressions, they can be can also be broken down itnot smaller and smaller parts. When doing so we need to know operations to evaluate first. For that we can use the same [PEMDAS rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) you likely learned in middle school. Operations are evaluated **left to right** _except_ ...\n",
    "- operations inside **parentheses** (or other grouping operation) must be evaluated before ...\n",
    "- **exponents** and roots, which must be evaluated before ...\n",
    "- **multiplication** and **division**, which must be evaluated before ...\n",
    "- **addition** and **subtraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, `3*6+1/2` evaluates to 18.5 while `3*(6+1)/2` evaluates to 10.5. If in doubt about how an expression is going to be evaluated, use parentheses to force it to go the way you want it to go. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Punctuation is everything else we need to structure our statements.** We haven't seen much of that yet but we will. Besides **white space** (which we learned about in lesson 1) we will also use dots `.`, colons `:`, parentheses `()`, brackets `[]` and other symbols as hints to help Python break statements down into their various parts.
