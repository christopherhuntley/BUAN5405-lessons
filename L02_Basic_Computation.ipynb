Plato, for example, spent significant time on the idea of [essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism): the idea that **every entity (physical or conceptual) has an essential form** that defines its substance. That form has **features** comprised of facts that distinguish it from other entities. Entities also have **functions** that they carry out in the world. These essential forms and functions together define **types** or **categories** that are considered eternal, at which point philosophy starts to become theology ...\n","\n","Today, we still use this basic framework to model the world around us, though with slightly different terminology:\n","\n","- **Data** refers to facts. Each fact has a **value** that captures substance but not importance or meaning. The number 42 can mean lots of things to different people. If you are a Monty Python fan then perhaps you remember it from _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. If you are a baseball fan then 42 could be associated with Mariano Rivera or Jackie Robinson. Or it could just be the answer to \"What's 6 times 9?\" ... 42 of course, but only you are in base 13. \n","- **Information** refers to facts that have formal **meaning** and **structure**. When associating facts to entities, the facts are given names, kind of like attaching sticky labels, so we know how each fact relates to the entity. For example we can say that 42 is the _uniform number_ (feature) of _Jackie Robinson_ (entity), the famous _baseball player_ (essential type). Data itself can also have a type, just like entities do. Is it 42 or \"42\" or 42.0? It matters a lot, at least to a data scientist. However, it's hard to tell without knowing how it is to be interpreted. \n","- **Knowledge** refers to functionality: the ability to use information to do things. A knowledgeable person can do a lot of things, once they have the necessary information. A less knowledgeable person might not be able to do anything useful, even if given perfect information. In Python, **the programs that we write are knowledge.** They are how we get the computer to do what we want it to do. \n","\n","As you may have noticed, each of these things builds on the ones before it.

A few basic principles apply, regardless of the language:\n","\n","- **Each name has to be unique** in the context they are being used. We can't, for example, have the same name for two different entities. We can label two different entities with the same name, but never at the same time. Variable assignment only allows one value at a time. \n","- **Names should be descriptive** enough that we, the programmers, know what each one stands for. Otherwise we can't follow each other's code without a road map, and who's got time for that? Even if we are the only ones to ever see the code, once a program gets larger than a couple dozen lines or so, it can get hard to remember everything. You want it to fit nicely in your head. \n","- **Names should also be short** enough that fat fingered typists can use them without lots of typos. \n","\n","The official [Python Language Definition](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) includes [some other rules](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers):\n","- names can include letters, numbers, and underscores\n","- names cannot start with a number\n","- names can be any length, but anything over 79 characters may not work in older versions of Python\n","- names must include at least one letter or an underscore (note: `_` by itself is a special variable in Jupyter)\n","\n","These are some examples of bad variable names in Python:\n","- `x`, `c`, `fizz`, `buzz`, `name` are not very descriptive. Only use these for sections of code where the meanings can easily be deduced by context or convention.\n","- `this_is_the_theme_for_garrys_show` is certainly descriptive if it refers to the theme some from the _Garry Shandling Show_ but it may also be a bit long and too specific. What if Garry had chosen to rename his theme song? All our code would be trashed. \n","- `in`, `for`,`def`, etc. are keywords. They are already taken.\n","- `My Drive` has spaces in it. Python can't tell that `My` and `Drive` are part of the same name. **Use underscores (`_`) between words** instead. \n","- `My_Drive` is also improper. In Python **variables should be lower case letters only.** Python will accept capital letters, but other programmers will complain. It's just not done. \n","- `dollar$` is a bad name because it includes an illegal character. Leave that stuff for other languages. Python wants it clean. \n","\n","While this section is about variable names, **many of these same rules also apply to just everything else**:\n","- Functions\n","- Files\n","- Data types\n","- Libaries and modules\n","- ...\n","\n","There are a couple notable exceptions, though:\n","- CONSTANTS (i.e., variables that don't actually vary) should be in `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`\n","- Third-party data types (a.k.a., `classes`) should use `CamelCaseNaming` where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no underscores. \n","\n","These are nonstandard because they are _intended_ to stand out.

The grammar rules defined there break each sentence down into variables, operations, keywords, literals, and punctuation. Everything is covered in fine detail. Consider, for example, how Python defines integer numbers:   \n","![Integer Grammar Rule](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN5405-lessons/raw/master/img/L2_1_Integer_Grammar.png)  \n","While the notation (called BNF grammar, first used to design Fortran) is pretty arcane, just know that these 10 grammar rules (one per line) together describe every possible integer in every possible format recognized by Python. \n","\n","So far we have only seen a few kinds of statements. The examples so far have been mostly assignment statements, which _always_ follow the same pattern: _`variable = expression`_. As we learned before, the _`expression`_ on the right is always evaluated first and then assigned to the _`variable`_ on the left. \n","\n","**An expression is anything that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expressions _are_ things.** So, each calculation like `1+1` or `first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an expression, but so is recalling the value of a variable like `first_name` or `last_name`. They each produce a value when evaluated. Expressions can be composed of other expressions. In order to evaluate them Python will break them down into smaller and smaller expressions, until all that's left is some combination of variables, operators, and **literal** values. **Literals** are things like numbers or text strings that don't need to be broken down any further. \n","\n","**An operator represents a calculation with a symbol like `+` or `%`.** In order for operators to be useful they have to be applied to one or more **operands** according to a specific pattern. So, for example, the `+` operator follows this pattern: _`expression1 + expression2`_, where the operands are `expression1` and `expression2`.  In principle, an operator can have any number of operands: unary operators have one operand, binary operators have two, ternary operators have three, etc. However, all of Python's built-in operators are binary, with one operand on the left and another on the right. \n","\n","When we apply an operator to a set of operands we call it an **operation**. Since operations always produce a value, they are also expressions and can also be broken down into smaller and smaller parts. When doing so we need to know which operations to evaluate first. For that we can use the same [PEMDAS rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) you likely learned in middle school. Operations are evaluated **left to right** _except_ ...\n","- operations inside **parentheses** (or other grouping operation) must be evaluated before ...\n","- **exponents** and roots, which must be evaluated before ...\n","- **multiplication** and **division**, which must be evaluated before ...\n","- **addition** and **subtraction**\n","\n","Thus, `3*6+1/2` evaluates to 18.5 while `3*(6+1)/2` evaluates to 10.5. If in doubt about how an expression is going to be evaluated, use parentheses to force it to go the way you want it to go. \n","\n","**Punctuation is everything else we need to structure our statements.** We haven't seen much of that yet but we will. Besides **white space** (which we learned about in lesson 1) we will also use dots `.`, colons `:`, parentheses `()`, brackets `[]` and other symbols as hints to help Python break statements down into their various parts.  \n","\n","### Pulse Check ..."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a35ozPvXPJlX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Why aren't expressions considered statements?** (After all, they do calculate things.)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BmYfq3ZuPJlX","colab_type":"text"},"source":["YOUR ANSWER HERE"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"deb1LB1tPJlY","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Why is the equals sign not an operator?** (This one is very subtle.

However, sometimes it is useful to mix human-friendly **comments** into our computer code. Comments are used like annotations, explaining what a bit of code does so we don't have to figure it out again later. \n","\n","In Python we use the _hash_ symbol `#` to indicate comments. Everything on a line of code after the `#` is ignored by Python.

In fact, you may want to **write the comments first, before writing any Python code.** That way you can plan things out in **pseudo-code** before having to think in Python. First write out the logic as pseudo-code comments and then add Python statements to implement them.   "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dFooHQ9fPJla","colab_type":"text"},"source":["---\n","## Pro Tips \n","\n","### Literate Programming\n","The best programs don't actually need a lot of comments beyond whatever is needed for basic documentation. Instead, every effort is made to make the code itself as easy to read and interpret as possible. Such code is said to be **literate** because an experienced programmer can read it like a book. When your code gets to book length -- a mobile app might have 100,000 lines of code -- you really start to appreciate the value of readability. While it might not be possible to make your code readable while you are creating and debugging it, professionals always take the time to clean it up afterwards. The Python Style Guide for Code (PEP-8) provides lots of recommendations and even some tools to help you do the cleanup. \n","\n","### Syntax Highlighting\n","Programming environments like Jupyter often come with real-time (as you type) syntax parsing for whatever language you are using at the time. The result is that code is highlighted according to function in that language. The actual colors may vary (e.g., JupyterHub uses green for keywords while Google Colab uses purple in code cells and blue in text cells) but the actual Python grammar rules don't. So, if you forgot the second double-quote at the end of a string literal, then all code after that will appear in whatever color is used for string literals. Similarly, if a variable name appears in the same color as the one for keywords, you know that you are going to need to rename the variable to something else. That name is already taken. \n","\n","### Commenting Out\n","Comments are used for more than just annotating code. When a block of code isn't working it can be useful to \"comment out\" code as we narrow down the source of the error. For example, consider what happens when we run the code above:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_n8V3OJvPJlb","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"cd619bab-e442-463c-ae2f-0ba3b5ebee83"},"source":["# stock the fridge\n","the_fridge = [\"bud\", \"bud\", \"stella\", \"miller\",\"homebrew\"]\n","the_fridge += [\"heinie\"] # don't forget the Heineken\n","\n","# drink each beer in the fridge, one at a time\n","for beer in the_fridge:\n","    empty_bottle = drink(beer)\n","    burp()                # that's why we drink beer, right? \n","    dispose(empty_bottle) # don't just leave empties lying around\n","\n","    # be joyful\n","    print(beer)           \n","    print(\"And another one gone, and another one gone, another one bites the dust.\")"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'drink' is not defined","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-9-b0e9c397359b>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# drink each beer in the fridge, one at a time\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      6\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mfor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mbeer\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mthe_fridge\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 7\u001b[0;31m     \u001b[0mempty_bottle\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mdrink\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mbeer\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      8\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mburp\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m                \u001b[0;31m# that's why we drink beer, right?\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      9\u001b[0m     \u001b[0mdispose\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mempty_bottle\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# don't just leave empties lying around\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'drink' is not defined"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5nE9DVoJPJlc","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Oops.
