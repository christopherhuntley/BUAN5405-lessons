    "## Abstraction and the DRY Principle\n",
    "> \"A designer knows that he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\" -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery\n",
    "\n",
    "While many novice programmers assume that the best programs have the most lines of code and the most features, it's usually quite the opposite. With every line of code you are potentially introducing a bug! Keeping it simple and lean is always best. By extension, the best programmers are, as Joel Spolsky once observed, \"lazy but smart.\" They tend to talk in simple, grammatically correct sentences, enunciating every word, perhaps even pronouncing the \"t\" in \"often.\" They are the most likely to wear tee-shirts and jeans to work because they are comfortable and what you wear doesn't define who you are anyway. There is a kind of geeky elegance in that that many others, especially their bosses but sometimes their spouses, tend to miss ... until crunch time when it really matters. Then suddenly everybody is waiting for the programmers to squash every bug and nobody cares what they wear. While nobody is advocating you wear a tee-shirt to your next staff meeting, there is something to be learned from watching programmers do their best work. \n",
    "\n",
    "In its highest forms, programming is about creating _elegant_ code that just works. A skilled programmer has the rare ability to **abstract the essential from the concrete.** Given a block of code that does X, they will winnow it down to its bare logical essence and then parameterize it (i.e., with variables) so it can be reused over and over again, even in novel situations that never occured to anybody before. They _are_ both lazy and smart. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases they will do this abstraction process without being asked. They call it the **DRY (\"Don't Repeat Yourself\") principle**. After you have done something the second or third time, it begins to become worth your time to see that it gets done right every time, with a minimum of effort. That, ultimately, is the essence of programming (pun intended). \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is about **functions** that **encapsulate** logic into reusable components. We will start with functions that come built into Python and then define some of our own.   "
