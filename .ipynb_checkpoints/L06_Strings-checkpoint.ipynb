    "## The Type Hierarchy\n",
    "> \"There are 10 kinds of people in this world, those who know binary and those who don't.\" -- anonymous nerd lore\n",
    "\n",
    "In this world of Big Data where computational power and data storage capacity have become commodities measured out like sugar or produce, it is easy for non-programmers to forget that it hasn't always been this way, that actual people had to design and build the technology up over many decades. The modern world is by design, not accident, or so we like to believe. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the very beginning, all data and programs were **encoded** as **binary**: strings of zeroes and ones called **bits** where every few bits represented something else. We still use binary (at least in digital computers), of course, but not many people speak it natively anymore. It's just too computer-specific and hard for us humans to process. Instead, we use an ever evolving repertoire of **languages** and **data structures** to express ourselves and keep our data safe and useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the **bit** the next standard data type was the **byte**, composed of 8 bits with 256 possible values, which is just enough to encode each key on a computer keyboard. Thus, [**ASCII**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was born. ASCII used seven of the bits (i.e., 128 possible values) for the keyboard codes, with the last bit available for error checking. Each character was assigned a number (e.g., \"A\" = binary `1000001` = decimal 65). Upper case letters were separate from lower case letters (\"a\" = `1100001` = 97) and every \"control\" character (e.g. tab, line ending, end of file, etc.) has an ASCII encoding as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "When strung together, **bytes** could represent lots of things as **strings**, **integers**, and **floats**, which you will recognize as native Python data types. From there it was natural to think of more elaborate data structures like complex numbers or lists. These in turn led to decimal and fractional numbers, and file, array, list, tuple, and dictionary collections. Today the Python standard library includes dozens of data types, each with its own unique properties and uses. And, if none of these quite do what we want, we can always create our own. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson starts our explorations into the world of data structures with a review of the **string data type**, which in practice is the most commonly used data structure of all. While we analytics geeks would likely prefer to have quantitative data all the time, if a human is involved in its collection or communication then it almost certainly will start as text strings. "

    "Many people are surprised to learn that in its original form, the entirety of the world wide web was text. Even the images were encoded into text! The web browser's job was to take all the strings of text coming over the wire -- there was no wifi back then -- and display web pages that people could view and interact with. Why text? Because just about anything can be encoded as text. It also allowed people to hand-craft web pages with HTML. While the web has progressed a lot since then, most content is still ... text. \n",

    "The main difference between a _generator_ and a normal function is that it uses `yield` instead of `return`. After a `return` from a function Python forgets everything that happened, starting fresh with the next function call. With `yield`, however, the function instead puts all of its state (variables and current statement pointer) on ice before it leaves. Then with the next call of the generator, it thaws out the state and execution goes right where it was, yielding the next item in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need generators if we can use lists? Because generators work for **infinite** (or at least impossibly huge) sequences that are too big to fit into memory all at once. The generator can yield items one at a time without having to remember the previous items or predict the remaining ones. To create all the digits of π (a sequence that never ends), one could use a generator function that calculates the digits one at a time.   "
