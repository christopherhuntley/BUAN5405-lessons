    "Now that we have pandas in our quiver, it would seem like \"what else do we need to know?\" Quite a lot actually. DataFrames and Series bring together so many best practices that programmers have earned and learned over the past decades. However, pandas does not say much about the types of data we pour into our DataFrames. For that we will often need to pull in other libraries with even more data types, many of which build on top of pandas or numpy to make our lives that much better. We will briefly cover two such data types: JSON trees and Time Series. \n",

    "In order to work with _really big data_ one usually has to gather it straight from the cloud. There is no concept of files, filenames, and filepaths in such an environment. Instead, we use **APIs** that provide **endpoints**, **query strings**, and ... **JSON data**. \n",

    "An Application Programming Interface (API) provides a standard set of functions (and perhaps a few configuration constants like security keys) for delivering a service. While there are APIs for lots of uses, the relevant ones for a data scientist are likely to be [ReST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). A ReST API uses the https protocol (i.e., the web) with specially-crafted request **endpoints** that tell the service what you want. Each endpoint combines a https command (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE) with a URL pattern indicating what data or other resource is being accessed. For example, the following ReST API call asks GitHub for details about this very notebook.  "
