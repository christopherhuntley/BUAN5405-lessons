        "The concepts in this lesson actually go all the way back to ancient times, when philosophers studied how they thought about ... thought. Plato, for example, spent significant time on the idea of [essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism): the idea that **every entity (physical or conceptual) has an essential form** that defines its substance. That form has **features** that characterize facts that distinguish it from other entities. Entities also have **functions** that they carry out in the world. These essential forms and functions together define **types** or **categories** that are considered eternal, at which point philosophy starts to become theology ...\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, we still use this basic framework to model the world around us, though with slightly different terminology:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data** refers to facts. Each fact has a **value** that captures substance instead of importance or meaning. The number 42 can mean lots of things to different people. If you are a Monty Python fan then perhaps you remember it from _The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. If you are baseball fan then it could mean Mariano Rivera or Jackie Robinson. Or it could just be the answer to \"What's 6 times 9?\" ... 42 of course, but only you are in base 13. \n",
        "- **Information** refers to facts that have an identified **meaning** and **structure**. When associating facts to entities the facts are given names, kind of like attaching sticky labels, so we know how each fact relates to the entity. For example we can say that 42 is the _Uniform Number_ (feature) of _Jackie Robinson, the famous baseball player_ (entity and essential type). Data can also have types, just like entities do. Is it 42 or \"42\" or 42.0? It matters a lot, at least to a data scientist. However, it's hard to tell without knowing how it is to be interpretted. \n",
        "- **Knowledge** refers to functionality: the ability to use information to do things. A knowledgable person can do a lot of things, once they have the necessary information. A less knowldgeable person might not be able to anything useful, even if given perfect information. In Python, **the programs that we write are knowledge.** It's how we get the computer to do what we want it to do. \n",
        "\n",
        "As you may have noticed, each of these things builds on the ones before it. We can of course continue on to wisdom (knowing what to do at a given time) and virtue (knowing right vs wrong), but it seems that we're getting back to theology again instead of science."

        "Sometimes you can learn a lot from just one line of code. For example, let's revisit a line from the section on variable assignment:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "person1 = first_name + \" \" + last_name\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this one line we see a **statement**, an **operator**, and **an expression**. (Actually, there are three expressions, two operators, and a text literal but who's counting?)\n",
        "- the entire line of code `person1 = first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an assignment **statement**\n",
        "- the addition **operator** is denoted by the plus sign `+`\n",
        "- the calculation `first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an **expression**\n",
        "\n",
        "**A statement is the Python equivalent of an imperative sentence. Statements _do_ things that change the state (value) of other things.** A statement is one semantically complete thought (for the programmer) or one syntactically complete unit of code for Python to execute. Each time we ask the computer to do something, we give it a statement. If we give the computer a sequence of statements then it executes them one at a time in the order they are given. \n",
        "\n",
        "Just as sentences in human language have syntactic structure (parts of speak), so do Python statements. In fact the precise grammar for all legal Python statements is defined in one surprisingly short document, [Python Language Definition](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html). The grammar rules defined there break each sentence down into expressions, operations, and punctuation. Everything is covered in fine detail. Consider, for example, how Python defines integer number:   \n",
        "![Integer Grammar Rule](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN5405-lessons/blob/master/img/L2_1_Integer_Grammar.png)\n",
        "While the notation (called BNF grammar, first used to design Fortran) is pretty arcane, just know that these 10 rules (one per line) together describe every possible integer in every possible format recognized by Python. \n",
        "\n",
        "So far we have only see a few kinds of statements. The example here is an assignment statement, which _always_ follows the same pattern: _`variable = expression`_. As we learned before, the expression on the right is always evaluated first and then assigned to the variable on the left. \n",
        "\n",
        "**An expression is anything that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expressions _are_ things.** So, each calculation like `1+1` or `first_name + \" \" + last_name` is an expression, but so is recalling the value of a variable like `first_name` or `last_name`. They each produce a value when evaluated. Expressions can be composed of other expressions. In order to evaluate them Pythhon will break them down into smaller and smaller expressions, until all that left is some combination of variables, operators, and **literal** values. **Literals** (or tokens) are things like numbers or text strings that don't need to be broken down any further. They are the words that make up our Python expressions. \n",
        "\n",
        "**An operator represents a calculation with a symbol like `+` or `%`.** In order for operators to be useful they have to be applied to one or more **operands** according to a specific pattern. So, for example, the `+` operator follows this pattern: _`expression1 + expression2`_, where the operands are `expression1` and `expression2`.  In principle, an operator can have any number of operands: unary operators have one operand, binary operators have two, ternary operators have three, etc. However, all of Python's built-in operators are binary. \n",
        "\n",
        "When we apply an operator to a set of operands we call it an **operation**. Since operations always produce a value, they are also expressions and can be can also be broken down into smaller and smaller parts. When doing so we need to know which operations to evaluate first. For that we can use the same [PEMDAS rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) you likely learned in middle school. Operations are evaluated **left to right** _except_ ...\n",
        "- operations inside **parentheses** (or other grouping operation) must be evaluated before ...\n",
        "- **exponents** and roots, which must be evaluated before ...\n",
        "- **multiplication** and **division**, which must be evaluated before ...\n",
        "- **addition** and **subtraction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, `3*6+1/2` evaluates to 18.5 while `3*(6+1)/2` evaluates to 10.5. If in doubt about how an expression is going to be evaluated, use parentheses to force it to go the way you want it to go. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Punctuation is everything else we need to structure our statements.** We haven't seen much of that yet but we will. Besides **white space** (which we learned about in lesson 1) we will also use dots `.`, colons `:`, parentheses `()`, brackets `[]` and other symbols as hints to help Python break statements down into their various parts.  \n",
