    "# The Art of Programming\n",
    "While many people think of computer programming as a technical skill practiced by math nerds and engineering geeks, it is actually one of the most creative of all practical arts. It is sort of like science fiction. Think of a world in which all the rules are editable, where we can change the laws of physics if we want to and then see how the universe plays out. The only limitations would be on what you can imagine and how well you can craft the laws to match what you seeing in your head. That's computer programming! Programmers turn mind stuff into working code that can be run by anybody with a computer. What could be more creative!\n",

    "# What's a computer? Why do we care? \n",
    "Interestingly, the word \"computer\" has been around for hundreds of years. In the 18th and 19th centuries, a computer was a person, usually a woman, who was really good at math and computation. If you've seen the movie \"Hidden Figures\" then you saw what it was like to be a human computer. \n",

    "![ComputerHardware](img/L1_1_ComputerHardware.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we think of the computer like a student working on a group homework assignment (i.e., a program), then ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **CPU** is the student's brain. It thinks through and completes the assigned tasks one by one until the assignment is done. \n",
    "- The **main memory** (RAM) is a sheet of scrap paper or an app used to carry out the current task. It knows nothing of the past or the future, just the things necessary to complete the current task. \n",
    "- The **secondary memory** (disk) is a book, filing cabinet, or database used to recall facts left over from previous tasks. It knows nothing about what the computer is doing. It just stores and recalls data as requested. Because there may be a lot of things to sift through to find what you are looking for, it is a lot slower to use than the main memory.   \n",
    "- The **input and output** devices (built-in keyboard, monitor, mouse, etc.) are how the student communicates with other students in the workgroup. The communication is _almost_ immediate but it does take time to listen and respond.  \n",
    "- The **network** (bluetooth, wifi, internet, etc.) is how the student communicates with others outside the group. Communication over the network is much, much slower than within the group. It's also not as reliable, with plenty of miscommunciation and misunderstanding making some messages almost impossible to send and recieve. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we care?** Because just as a student does not want to put in all nighters when they could be hanging with their roommates, we want our programs to run as efficiently as was can manage. The word \"manage\" here is intentional. Just as some people are able to manage their time much better than others, some computer programmers manage to write good code without having to work so hard at it. While some of that is talent, most of it is practice and the discipline to get better over time. As any sports coach will tell you. Practice alone does not win games. _Good_ practice, with your mind and body fully engaged, is what wins games. "

In fact, Python has a base vocabulary of just 30 reserved words! All Python code is written with these words plus whatever other words we make up on our own! \n",
    "\n",
    "As for syntax, it is a small language, with just a few types of statements, yet flexible enough that a surprisng variety of regular English sentences work can be made to work, though perhaps with slightly altered phrasing and punctuation. Can you tell what this program does?\n",

Those are shown in green or blue: `for`, `in`,and `print`.   The syntax is also pretty sparse: an equal sign, some commas, a few brackets and parentheses, a colon, and **white space**. Yes, in Python the line ends and indentation matters. We'll come back to that shortly! \n",
