    ">\"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.\" -- Phil Karlton\n",
    "\n",
    "Counting is one of the first math skills we learn. By the age of 18 months, a child can usually carry out the basic steps of marking off the next item on a list. They might get confused by the sixth or seventh item -- perhaps counting the same item twice -- but **a toddler can usually count up to 5 items.** It's not like the process is that hard:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose an item from the pile.\n",
    "2. Mark off the item by saying the next number in the sequence. \n",
    "3. Place the item into another pile. \n",
    "4. Repeat 1-3 until there are no items left in the original pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is surprising how hard some novice programmers find it to **iterate** (mark off) items one at time. Given a list (or other sequence) of items to be processed exactly the same way, they will try to use what we call \"copy/paste/edit\" logic, modifying the code a little for the specifics of each item. Wow, what a complete waste of time. Instead, they should do exactly like the babies do: \n",
    "1. Take an item (it) off the list.\n",
    "2. Process it, taking note of any effects.\n",
    "3. If needed again, add it to an out-list of processed items.\n",
    "4. Repeat until the list is exhausted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides being more efficient for the programmer, it is also less buggy. The logic in step 2 is always the same, no matter how many times we repeat the loop. Why make things more difficult by doing it a different way each time?\n",
    "\n",
    "**This lesson is about iteration, the last of the four fundamental elements of Structured Programming.** By the end of this lesson you will know the basics of all programming logic. Everything else is somewhat derivative, as Edsger Dijkstra proved so many years ago. "

    "## More than Just Counting: How about Long Division?\n",
    "While counting may be the first iterative process we learn as children, it is far from the last. Another is **long division**, which children used to master as a right of passage in primary school, but today is (sadly) not seen as an educational necessity. Instead, children are told to use a calculator. While somewhat practical in an age when everybody has phones in their pockets, children are being cheated out of an important lesson in algorithmic thinking needed for higher forms of math like algebra and calculus. The effects are obvious to those of us who teach quantitative sciences for a living. Many young adults today cannot reliably calculate an average of ten numbers, **even when armed with a calculator to do the arithmetic**. Instead they rely on tools like MS Excel that turn averaging into a feature instead of a process, which over time leads to a lack of intuitive understanding of important analytical concepts like centrality and variability. They see the world as static, with all the processing already done, all the data already processed, when real world data is anything but static.  And it all starts (or, more properly, ends for many people) with long division. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have established its importance, what exactly is long division? Long division is a standard manual method for dividing one number (the **dividend**) by another (the **divisor**). The result is called the **quotient**, which may include a **remainder** if the first number cannot be evenly divided by the second. Like counting, it involves repetition of a fixed set of steps (with examples shown for the first pass): \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the `dividend` and the `divisor`. For our purposes the dividend is treated as a string of digits that we can \"pull down\" (or, as we programmers call it, \"pop off\") one at a time starting from the left hand side. Similarly, we will build up the quotient one digit at a time by comparing the divisor with digits from the dividend. \n",
    "  * Set `dividend` = 1260257, `divisor` = 37, `quotient` = 0, `remainder` = 0.\n",
    "2. Pull down a digit `d` from the dividend and add it to the `remainder`.\n",
    "  * Set `remainder = 0 + d = 0 + 1 = 1`.\n",
    "3. Calculate a digit `q` by evenly dividing the `remainder` by the `divisor`, ignoring the non-integer fraction left over. (In Python we use the `//` operator for this sort of integer division.)\n",
    "  * Set `q = remainder // divisor = 1 // 37 = 0`; the first digit of the quotient is `0`. \n",
    "4. Calculate the `product` of `q` and the `divisor`.\n",
    "  * Set `product = q * divisor = 0`\n",
    "5. Subtract the `product` from the `remainder` and append the digit `q` to the `quotient`. \n",
    "  * The new `remainder` is (the previous) `remainder` - `product` or `1 - 0 = 1`.\n",
    "  * The new `quotient` is calculated as `quotient * 10 + q = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0`.\n",
    "6. Repeat steps 2-5 until no digits remain to pull down from the `dividend`. With each pass update the quotient by appending a digit to the right and update the remainder as indicated in step 5.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who like visuals, here is a useful animated GIF showing the rest of the process (after skipping the initial 0s in the quotient):\n",

    "- **Pull down the next digit from the `dividend` in step 2.** We can easily do this by treating the dividend as a text string. However, we will consider a more advanced way in Lesson 8. \n",

    "### Variable Updating\n",
    "Up to now whenever we have changed the value of a variable we have done it through variable (re-)assignment.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "something_happens()\n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Variable updating deals with the case where the same variable is on both sides of the equal sign `=`.** The classic and simplest case is adding 1 to `x` (as in counting):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = x + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since this is just a special case of variable assignment, the 3-step process we learned in Lesson 2 still applies:\n",
    "1. Recall the variable `x`, which already exists (or else we get an error).\n",
    "2. Evaluate the expression `x+1`, which adds 1 to the current value of `x` (but doesn't change `x` itself). \n",
    "3. Assign `x` the value calculated in step 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It makes sense, but only if you understand the order of things. The variable only has one value at a time, even though at first it looks like we are saying something sort of like `1 = 2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A couple remarks:\n",
    "- **The variable `x` need not refer to numerical values.** We can do the same thing with strings, lists, or any other data type supported by Python. The steps are the same each time.   \n",
    "- **We can subtract as easily as we can add.** In fact, any expression can be on the right side. It just has to include the variable from the left hand side of the `=`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve execution efficiency and eliminate spelling errors, Python has built-in **update operators** (a.k.a. \"augmented assignment statements\") for certain special cases:\n",
    "- `x += 1` is the same as `x = x + 1`  \n",
    "- `x -= 1` is the same as `x = x - 1`  \n",
    "\n",
    "You should get the general idea. Other update operators include `/=`, `*=`, `@=` (for matrix multiplication), and a few more obscure ones. In practice you will likely only encounter `+=` and `-=`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Updating in Long Division\n",
    "The long division process includes 3 variable updates:\n",
    "- `remainder = remainder*10 + int(d)` (from step 2; recall that `d` was the next in a string of digits in the dividend)\n",
    "- `remainder -= product` (from step 5; subtracts the product from the remainder)\n",

    "- Most of the time you will need to **initialize a variable (i.e., assign it a value)** used in your boolean expression so that it evaluates to True the first time. That same variable (often what is called an _accumulator_) will likely need to be updated with each pass of the loop. Often we do that at the end of the loop body. \n",
    "- **Just as with `if` statements, don't forget the colons.** They are needed by Python to know where the boolean expression ends.\n",
    "- **We can create infinite loops by short-circuiting the boolean expression** (e.g., `while True: ...`). Then it is up to the loop body to terminate the loop using a `break` statement, which works similarly to what `return` does for functions. **Anytime that Python encounters a `break` it terminates the enclosing loop.**\n",

    "The Py4E textbook uses the term _accumulator_ for variables like `count` or `total` that are updated inside loops. Accumulators act as a kind of process memory, building up (accumulating) a record of what has happened so far. Another accumulator was the `quotient` in our long division codes. We built it up one digit at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "While these sorts of accumulators are great for introducing the concept, they are but the simplest examples of a much broader set of possibilities. We can, for example, accumulate transaction records at an ATM, or grades in a course, or ... well, just about anything that requires a precise record of past _iterations_ of a process. A database accumulates data and makes it persistent. A CSV file accumulates records with each row that is added. A machine learning model accumulates accuracy statistics with each test exemplar. (Yes, \"exemplar\" is a word. Look it up.) In each case, the pattern is the same: accumulation of artifacts from iterating over a set of items. And now we know how to handle each of these cases in our code. "
