AWK was a text processing language developed at Bell Labs in the 1970s by the same team that created C and Unix. It was designed to be a tiny domain-specific language for working with streaming text data. One would feed data to an AWK script one line at a time. AWK would then output text to an output file, also one line at a time. It could, of course, remember things from one line to the next, allowing it to accumulate information along the way. \n","\n","Soon I was using AWK for lots of text processing tasks. One notable application was to translate mainframe data into SQL code for loading into a relational database. Data would come in one line at a time and then right into the database. I think I got at least one promotion from just this one parlor trick. A year or so later, in late 1995 or early 1996, I used the same trick to develop a dashboarding web app that was cobbled together with AWK and bash scripts. No Perl. No Python. No PHP. No Java. Just AWK and bash on a Unix command line. I am still amazed that it worked but we never had a crash or any other bug reported.   \n","\n","One of the reasons why I loved AWK so much was a feature called \"associative arrays\" where we could index a variable length array with text **keys** instead of integers. We could even mix keys with integer indexes if we liked. This meant that, for example, I could have an array of birthdays indexed by people's names. Or vice versa if that was what I wanted.  Or, I could create a histogram for words in a file with two lines of code. The potential uses seemed endless. Nothing could have been more convenient for a wannabe smart and lazy programmer. \n","\n","The Python equivalent of an associative array is a **dictionary**. It does many of the same things as a list but with keys instead of positions. Like associative arrays, there are an endless array of uses. If you have ever pulled data from a web API or added a Series to a DataFrame then you have used something like a dictionary. It's just how it's done.

Further, if the object being hashed is itself immutable then we have met all three requirements for dictionary keys:\n","\n","1. Each key has a unique hash. If two keys are the same then they generate the same hash.\n","2. Because the key is required to be immutable, then so is the hash.\n","3. Hashes are printable as (typically) very long strings of characters or digits. So, even if the key itself isn't printable, its hash is. \n","\n","Besides its obvious integrity advantages, hashing of keys is also highly very efficient. Since hashes are convertible to strings or integers, we can sort them just like list positions. That makes using a key to lookup a value just as efficient as using an integer index to look up a value in a list. (Ever used a primary key or index to speed up a SQL query? That's exactly the same thing.)\n","\n","While the precise hashing function may vary from data type to data type, the [default] uses a version of the Fowler-Noll-Vo algorithm which is outside the scope of this course.
