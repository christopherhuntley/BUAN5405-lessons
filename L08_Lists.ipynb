    "## C Arrays: A Lingering Legacy\n",
    "If we dig deep enough into the Python libraries, we eventually find that much of Python itself is actually written in C, a language that is still used for operating systems and certain high performance applications. C is about as close to programming in assembly language, one step up from machine code, as we might ever want to venture. Writing C code is like driving a 1960s muscle car: it runs everything as fast as possible but lacks any and all safety features. It is, as Ralph Nader famously described one muscle car, _Unsafe at Any Speed_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code in C that dealt with collections of things meant using *arrays*. A C array was a block of raw memory (RAM) set aside in advance to fit whatever data was poured into it (as bytes). The array data itself was always of one data type (usually `int`, `float`, or `char`) and it was darn near impossible to safely resize the array after the memory was allocated. Fortunately there was often not enough data available to need to resize the array. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the need to think too hard when creating arrays, smart and lazy programmers wrote utility code like this (from _Numerical Recipes in C_) to to handle basic memory management:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "\n",
    "float *vector(nl,nh)\n",
    "int nl, nh;\n",
    "Allocates a float Vector with range [n1..nh] \n",
    "{\n",
    "    v=(float *)malloc((unsigned) (nh-nl+1)*sizeof(float);\n",
    "    if ((!v) nerror(\"allocation failure in vector()\");\n",
    "    return v-nl;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What a great innovation! We could specify that we wanted a `float` vector array with indexes `nl` to `nh` and it would do all the tricky math for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, come the bad part. Let's say that we have allocated an array to hold 100 `floats` but then we try to insert 101 floats into it? C would just do it anyway, overwriting whatever was already in memory just beyond the alloctaed block of 100. The result? Usually either a major security bug or a random system crash. It was possible to write code that would run flawlessly for days at a time before randomly crashing. The programmer then might spend weeks hunting through the code looking for the error. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is perhaps no surprise that smart and lazy programmers tend to write their code in Python these days. It's just so much more time efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has an data type called `array` that is like the old C arrays but with all the data protections built in. Not many people use it, however. Instead they just use a `list` which is so much more convenient:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list can contain **any number of items**, subject to how much memory is available.\n",
    "- Each list item can be of **any data type**. We can even **mix data types** within the list. \n",
    "- Lists can be **extended**, **sliced**, and even **truncated** as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen lists in action in the previous lessons. In this lesson we will fill in the details.  "

    "Just as assignment to a list creates an alias, so it also works for functions. After all, a function parameter is just a kind of local variable. The parameters get set via assignment from the arguments just before executing the funtion body. So, if the function modifies the list in any way, then the modifications live on after the function is done. If That is not what you want, then be sure to pass copies as arguments instead of the lists themselves. That way the _copies_ get aliased and then discarded after the function returns.  "
