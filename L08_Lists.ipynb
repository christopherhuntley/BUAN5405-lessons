    "## C Arrays: A Lingering Legacy\n",
    "If we dig deep enough into the Python libraries, we eventually find that much of Python itself is actually written in C, a language that is still commonly used for operating systems and certain high performance applications. C is about as close to programming in assembly language, one step up from machine code, as we might ever want to venture. Writing C code is like driving a 1960s muscle car: it runs everything as fast as possible but lacks any and all safety features. It is, as Ralph Nader famously described one muscle car, _Unsafe at Any Speed_.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing code in C that dealt with collections of things meant using *arrays*. A C array was a block of raw memory (RAM) set aside in advance to fit whatever data was poured into it (as bytes). The array data itself was always of one data type (usually `int`, `float`, or `char`) and it was darn near impossible to safely resize the array after the memory was allocated. Fortunately in the heyday of C for data analysis datasets tended to be small enough to estimate in advance how much memory was needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the need to think too hard when creating arrays, smart and lazy programmers wrote utility code like this (from _Numerical Recipes in C_) to handle basic memory management with some degree of safety:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "\n",
    "float *vector(nl,nh)\n",
    "int nl, nh;\n",
    "Allocates a float Vector with range [n1..nh] \n",
    "{\n",
    "    v=(float *)malloc((unsigned) (nh-nl+1)*sizeof(float);\n",
    "    if ((!v) nerror(\"allocation failure in vector()\");\n",
    "    return v-nl;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What a great innovation! We could specify that we wanted a `float` array of a given size (`nh-nl+1`) and it would do all the tricky math for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the scary part ... Let's say that we have allocated an array to hold 100 items but then we try to insert 101 items into it? C would just do it anyway, overwriting whatever was already in memory just beyond the end of the array. The result? Usually either a major security bug or a random system crash. It was possible to write code that would run flawlessly for days at a time before randomly crashing. The programmer then might spend weeks hunting through the code looking for the error. Imagine if you had to run something a week at a time just to test it one time! You would make sure you looked over every line of code a dozen times before kicking off the next test. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is perhaps no surprise that smart and lazy programmers tend to write their code in Python these days. It's just so much more time efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a data type called `array` that is like the old C arrays but with all the proper data protections built in. Not many people use it, however. Instead they just use a `list` which is so much more convenient:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list can contain **any number of items**, subject to how much memory is available.\n",
    "- Each list item can be of **any data type**. We can even **mix data types** within the list. \n",
    "- Lists can be **extended**, **sliced**, and even **truncated** as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen lists in action in the previous lessons. In this lesson we will fill in the details.  "

So, if the function modifies the list in any way, then the modifications live on after the function is done.

    "### List Comprehensions\n",
    "A list comprehension is a quirky one-line combination of a `for` loop with a conditional expression. The result is a list. The syntax is\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[ expression for item in sequence if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- the `for` loop iterates through the sequence\n",
    "- if the condition (which likely includes `item`\n",
    "- the value of the expression (which also includes `item`) is added to the list\n",
    "\n",
    "It is equivalent to \n",
    "```python\n",
    "lst = [] # an empty list\n",
    "for item in sequence:\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        lst += expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "Except, of course, that the comprehension doesn't need to create a local variable for the list. A comprehension is an expression to be evaluated, not a statement to be executed. If we want the comprehension to be remembered then we use an assignment statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are very handy at times, especially when you only need a list one time, say as an argument to a function call. You may never need to use one, but when you do, it can save a lot of effort. "
